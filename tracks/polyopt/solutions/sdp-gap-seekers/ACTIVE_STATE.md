# Challenge 88 active state

Updated: 2026-07-29 UTC.

- Fixed setup: Shastry--Sutherland `J_dimer=1`, `J_square=4/5`,
  level-1 local-consistency window, unrestricted KMS class, `d=2`.
- Exact finite-relaxation reduction remains unchanged: 74,602 source moments
  to 19,108 invariant moments; 11 PSD blocks; maximum side 109.
- Active branch: `bohr/challenge88-ss-reduced-runner`, based on
  `5e84422586c8de8acb58699a1102a28353291562`.
- Gamma=0 truth gate: passed on attempt r3, Slurm job `22987983`.
- Attempt `ss-reduced-g0p8-gamma0-xh5-20260729-r1`, Slurm job `22987967`,
  validated both input hashes, all runmeta fields, and every source-file hash,
  then stopped before Mosek because MOF reload exposes the Hermitian cone value
  in packed-vector form. Peak process RSS was 736,680 KiB.
- The next runner revision explicitly reconstructs Hermitian matrices from
  MOI's real-upper/imaginary-upper packing. This is a consequential decoding
  change; the failed attempt is not being repeated unchanged.
- Attempt `ss-reduced-g0p8-gamma0-xh5-20260729-r2`, Slurm job `22987979`,
  passed the complete MOF structure gate, then stopped before `optimize!`
  because MosekTools 0.15.10 requires the raw string attribute
  `MSK_IPAR_NUM_THREADS`, not Mosek.jl's enum. Peak process RSS was
  667,068 KiB. The next revision changes that optimizer API call.
- Attempt `ss-reduced-g0p8-gamma0-xh5-20260729-r3` returned `OPTIMAL` with
  primal and dual `FEASIBLE_POINT`. Normalization was exactly 1; all three
  affine residuals and the worst PSD violation were 0 at the declared `1e-7`
  audit tolerance. The smallest eigenvalue across all 11 reconstructed blocks
  was 0.0948505094335904. Solver wall was 444.861 s; peak process RSS was
  46,385,640 KiB. `result.toml` SHA-256 is
  `ec362cdf456a7ad7f180ce2418bcea1b547f831c8d0c21cfc827844b2e06258e`.
- Gamma=1/2 target: passed on attempt r1, Slurm job `22988032`. Mosek returned
  `OPTIMAL` with primal and dual `FEASIBLE_POINT`; normalization was exactly 1,
  all three affine residuals and the worst PSD violation were 0, and the
  smallest block eigenvalue was 0.08943315828795756. Solver wall was
  407.505 s; peak process RSS was 44,494,548 KiB. `result.toml` SHA-256 is
  `63c3ed036605c9ed15e67e762115bf73f67b1724b7e6ea6281cf21559b1dc021`.
- Terminal status: the requested exact finite relaxation is numerically
  feasible at gamma=1/2. This does not prove a physical bulk gap; it says this
  `d=2` relaxation does not exclude gamma=1/2.
- Required solve order was satisfied: gamma=1/2 ran only after the
  residual-checked gamma=0 result.
- Compute boundary: all MOF reload/solve work runs through Slurm on xH5;
  Bohrium and xH5 login are limited to source checks, Git, transfer, queue
  inspection, and artifact collection.
- The generic Hermitian-to-real solver bridge scalarizes the eight positive
  blocks into 126,525 semidefinite coordinates and produces a
  1.45--1.51-billion-nonzero factor. This representation, rather than the
  maximum side dimension 109, explains the 44--46 GiB solve peak.
- Active exact-memory route: computational-basis conjugation averaging plus
  a diagonal phase gauge. If its exhaustive xH5 truth gate passes, the same
  finite relaxation uses real PSD blocks with 31,807 positive-cone
  coordinates, plus three scalar gap blocks. No immutable source file or
  supplied MOF is modified.
- No decision-changing user or resource need is open.

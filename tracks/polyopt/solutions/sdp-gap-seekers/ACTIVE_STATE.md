# Challenge 88 active state

Updated: 2026-07-29 UTC.

- Fixed setup: Shastry--Sutherland `J_dimer=1`, `J_square=4/5`,
  level-1 local-consistency window, unrestricted KMS class, `d=2`.
- Exact finite-relaxation reduction remains unchanged: 74,602 source moments
  to 19,108 invariant moments; 11 PSD blocks; maximum side 109.
- Active branch: `bohr/challenge88-ss-reduced-runner`, based on
  `5e84422586c8de8acb58699a1102a28353291562`.
- Current gate: gamma=0 runner retry after two fail-closed startup rejections.
- Attempt `ss-reduced-g0p8-gamma0-xh5-20260729-r1`, Slurm job `22987967`,
  validated both input hashes, all runmeta fields, and every source-file hash,
  then stopped before Mosek because MOF reload exposes the Hermitian cone value
  in packed-vector form. Peak process RSS was 736,680 KiB.
- The next runner revision explicitly reconstructs Hermitian matrices from
  MOI's real-upper/imaginary-upper packing. This is a consequential decoding
  change; the failed attempt is not being repeated unchanged.
- Attempt `ss-reduced-g0p8-gamma0-xh5-20260729-r2`, Slurm job `22987979`,
  passed the complete MOF structure gate, then stopped before `optimize!`
  because MosekTools 0.15.10 requires the raw string attribute
  `MSK_IPAR_NUM_THREADS`, not Mosek.jl's enum. Peak process RSS was
  667,068 KiB. The next revision changes that optimizer API call.
- Required solve order: gamma=0 first; gamma=1/2 only after gamma=0 returns a
  residual-checked feasible point.
- Compute boundary: all MOF reload/solve work runs through Slurm on xH5;
  Bohrium and xH5 login are limited to source checks, Git, transfer, queue
  inspection, and artifact collection.
- No decision-changing user or resource need is currently open.
